IoT - Environmental Monitoring 


A Sample project on how to Connect BLE IoT sensor devices ( SensorTags Manufactored by Texas Instruments) using a Raspberry PI to Microsoft Azure Cloud.


Required components: 

- Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian OS installed.
- Texas Instruments SensorTags BLE devices. "c2650stk-sensortag-kit"
- Node.js version 4.X
- Bluetooth v 4.0
- Microsoft Azure IoT Hub 


Using Microsoft Azure "IoT Hub" & "Stream analytics" services to connect our Gateway push the stream of Data to Azure to be stored as logs and previewed in Microsoft Power BI. 


Sensor Data is displayed in real time and can be viewed both on Browser and Mobile Application.
